Topic :- Array
Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location.
It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:
Syntax:-

         dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
         or
         dataType arrayRefVar[];  // works but not preferred way.
         
Example
The following code snippets are examples of this syntax âˆ’

double[] myList;   // preferred way.
or
double myList[];   // works but not preferred way.

Problem :- Take 10 integer inputs from user and store them in an array. Now, copy all the elements in an another array but in reverse order.

sample input:-  
Enter the value of a[0]
 15
Enter the value of a[1]
17
Enter the value of a[2]
18
Enter the value of a[3]
20
Enter the value of a[4]
45
Enter the value of a[5]
34
Enter the value of a[6]
54
Enter the value of a[7]
43
Enter the value of a[8]
32
Enter the value of a[9]
44
Sample output :-
The value of b[0] is 44
The value of b[1] is 32
The value of b[2] is 43
The value of b[3] is 54
The value of b[4] is 34
The value of b[5] is 45
The value of b[6] is 20
The value of b[7] is 18
The value of b[8] is 17
The value of b[9] is 15
