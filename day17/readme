Topic :- do-while loops

Java do-while loops are very similar to the while loops, but it always executes the code block at least once and furthermore as long as the condition remains true.
This loop is an exit-controlled loop.
      
      syntax :-
do
  {
      statement(s);

   }while( condition );

                    Enter your choice y or n
                     Y

                     0
                    Enter your choice y or n
