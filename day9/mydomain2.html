What Are HTML Tags?
Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets.
An example of a tag is: <h1>.
  
Opened tag = <h1> and Closed tag = </h1>
  
<!DOCTYPE html> — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. 
In previous example in my domain1, the language is HTML 5.

<html> — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.

<head> — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.

<body> — This is where the content of the page goes.
  
Inside the <head> tag, there is one tag that is always included: <title>, but there are others that are just as important:

<title>
This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the top of the browser window or tab.
  
<meta>
This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.


#Tommorrow we will try out a basic <head> section:
