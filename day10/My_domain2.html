Previously we see the example of simple HTML document. 
Now we eplain the example of my previously example(mydomain1).

Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.

The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
  
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page.
  
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).
  
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
  
The <h1> element defines a large heading.
  
The <p> element defines a paragraph.
  
  
Now we discuss the basic head section.
  
The <head> section
The next part is the <head> section. The <head> element contains metadata (document title, character set, styles, links, scripts), 
specific information about the web page that is not displayed to the user.

The <meta> element is used to specify the metadata to provide browsers and search engines with technical information about the web page.

For example, if you want to specify the description of your page, you may use the <meta> element like this:

<meta name="description" content="This field contains information about your page. It is usually around two sentences long.">
