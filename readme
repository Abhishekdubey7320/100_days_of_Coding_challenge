Topic:- Java Program for Linear Search

Problem: Given an array arr[] of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in arr[]. 

ALGORITHM :
Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Declare an array and search element as key.
Step 3: Traverse the array until the number is found.
Step 4: If the key element is found, return the index position of the array element
Step 5: If the key element is not found, return -1
Step 6: Stop.

Output:- 
       Element found at position 1
       
The best-case time complexity of the linear search is o(1).
The worst-case time complexity of the linear search is o(n)
The SPACE complexity of the linear search is o(1).
