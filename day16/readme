Topic:- do-while loops
Java do-while loops are very similar to the while loops, but it always executes the code block at least once and furthermore as long as the condition remains true.
This loop is an exit-controlled loop.

syntax :-
do
  {
      statement(s);

   }while( condition );
   
Question :-Write a program to calculate HCF of Two given number take as the input from the number.

conditions :- do
          {
          remainder = dividend % divisor
             if(remainder==0)
                {
                divisor=hcf;
                }
                else{
                dividend=divisor;
                divisor=remainder;
                } 
                }while(remainder != 0);

Input : first number (dividend)= 55
        second number(divisor)= 15
output : HCF: 5
