Topic :- for loop

Java for loop is used to run a block of code for a certain number of times. The syntax of for loop is:

for (initialExpression; testExpression; updateExpression) {
    // body of the loop
    }

Here,

The initialExpression initializes and/or declares variables and executes only once.
The condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the body of the for loop is executed.
The updateExpression updates the value of initialExpression.
The condition is evaluated again. The process continues until the condition is false.

Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n is input by user. 
1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +…………1/n 

sample input :-
           Enter number of terms of series : 5
           
sample output:- sum: 2.283333333333333
