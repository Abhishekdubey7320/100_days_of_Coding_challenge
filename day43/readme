Topic:- Java InputStream Class

The InputStream class of the java.io package is an abstract superclass that represents an input stream of bytes.

Since InputStream is an abstract class, it is not useful by itself. However, its subclasses can be used to read data.

Subclasses of InputStream
In order to use the functionality of InputStream, we can use its subclasses. Some of them are:

FileInputStream
ByteArrayInputStream
ObjectInputStream

Create an InputStream
In order to create an InputStream, we must import the java.io.InputStream package first. Once we import the package, here is how we can create the input stream.

// Creates an InputStream
InputStream object1 = new FileInputStream();
Here, we have created an input stream using FileInputStream. It is because InputStream is an abstract class. Hence we cannot create an object of InputStream.

Note: We can also create an input stream from other subclasses of InputStream.

Program: - Try to read file using FileInputStream (a subclass of InputStream).
Output

Available bytes in the file: 40
Data read from the file: 
I am learning inputStream class in java.                                                            

Explanation:-
In this program, we have created an input stream using the FileInputStream class. The input stream is linked with the file input.txt.

InputStream input = new FileInputStream("input.txt");
To read data from the input.txt file, we have implemented these two methods.

input.read(array);  // to read data from the input stream
input.close();            // to close the input stream
