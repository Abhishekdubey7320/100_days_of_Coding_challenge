Topic :- Array
Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location.
It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:
Syntax:-

         dataType[] arrayRefVar;   // preferred way.
   
Program:- Write a program in array  to print all the array elements ,sum of the elments and also find the largest element in the array.

sample input:-1.9
              2.9
              3.4
              3.5
sample output :- 1.9 
                 2.9 
                 3.4 
                 3.5 
            Total is 11.7
             Max is 3.5
             
Explainantion:- In this program first we  print all the elements which is present in the array of length 4. we use for loop for the printing all elements.
Example:-        for (int i = 0; i < myList.length; i++) {
                System.out.println(myList[i] + " ");
            }
            Now, for sum of the  elements we take  datatype double Total=0; and again with the help of for loop, we add the all elements and stored in Total and then print total.
Example:-       double total = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < myList.length; i++) {
                total += myList[i];
            }
      And in last we have to find the largest elements so we take max of datatype double is equal to the array of index [0] and simply with the help of for loop 
      increment the loop and print the largest element.
Example:-  double max = myList[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < myList.length; i++) {
                if (myList[i] > max) max = myList[i];
            }
